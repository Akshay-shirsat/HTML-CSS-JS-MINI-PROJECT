Key Features
Workflows - Workflows run automations. Workflows are sequence of steps - pre-built actions or custom .js code - triggered by an event (HTTP request, timer,  and more).

Event Sources - Sources trigger workflows. They emit events from services like GitHub, Slack, Airtable, RSS and more. When you want to run a workflow when an event happens in any third-party app, you're using an event source.

Actions - Actions are pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common operations across Pipedream's 500+ API integrations. For example, you can use actions to send email, add a row to a Google Sheet, and more.

Custom code - Most integrations require custom logic. Code is often the best way to express that logic, so Pipedream allows you to run any Node.js, Python, Golang, or Bash code. You can import any package from the languages' package managers, connect to any Pipedream connected app, and more. Pipedream is "low-code" in the best way: you can use pre-built components when you're performing common actions, but you can write custom code when you need to.
